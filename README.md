## Robotic Project

For now, trying to see if we can display the image data from our raspberry pi camera to our computer via socket. Then the computer will be able to do some image processing, then send data back to the raspberry pi so it could move some motors and stuff :)

`client.py` should be runned on the RPi, and `main.py` should be runned on the computer.
